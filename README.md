This project is a blank template for [Zebble](https://zebble.net/) projects. 
 
## What is Zebble?

Zebble is a framework for developing natives apps for iOS, Android, and Windows from a single source code base.

If you experienced any problem try the following:
1. Open a cmd and run Build.bat file and watch for errors. You might have missing components.
2. Make sure all nuget packages are successfully restored.
